Our team is committed to developing a product which is safe for stakeholders to interact with a mobile phone connected via WiFi, while also providing a motion capability that can be detected by moving into tight places.

## User Needs,Benchmarking,and Requirements

The complete User Needs is here<a href="User Needs and Benchmarking 303.pdf">Complete User Needs and Benchmarking</a>

* The first thing we did for user needs was that we set up a jam board so that each member of the team could write down the user needs they thought were important.

![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/Screenshot_20230118_120048.png?raw=true)

Then we separated them into 3 seperate catergories, "Tech Constraints", "Function", "Interactivity".

![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/Screenshot_20230122_105314.png?raw=true)

Lastly, we ranked them in order of importance. The proccess in which we ranked them was done by taking the user needs that we came up with and comparing them with customer needs from the voice of the customer.

After that we started Benchmarking and started listening to the voice of our Customer. 

Here is a example of our selected product:

And here is the user story we collected 

William is a father with two children. He wants to give his children an intellectual education of engineers at an early stage. He needs a robot that can attract children's attention with interesting performances, and at the same time has monitoring functions (such as temperature, humidity, wind, atmospheric pressure, etc.)

The user story proves that how necessary this product in the society.

* Then we researched the source and price of this product and the description of this product. At the same time, we also conducted research on the after-sales evaluation of this product. We extracted the customer needs we need from customer evaluations, and then transformed them into product requirements for our own robot research and development. (For complete research, please see the complete User Needs above)

Open Question

Can the product be designed with only recyclable materials in mind?

Can we incorporate in the design the ability to use a mobile phone to remotely control the movement of the product?
What are some examples of modules that can be interchanged within our design?
Does our actuator have to be connected to the sensor? Or can it only be connected with the microcontroller?

* After collecting user requirements, we began to brainstorm and come up with a hundred design ideas based on these user requirements (See Design Ideation below).

## Design Ideation

* The role of each person in the group was to come up with 50 design ideas each that in total came up to 100 ideas that we can potentially use in our design concepts.

* After coming up with the 100 ideas, we then came to together in person to brainstorm and decide which ideas were the best from the 100 ideas. We decided that brainstorming in person was more effective and successful then doing it virtually or seprately because we were able to come up with more ideas and better quality ideas.

* We then took the 100 ideas and came up with three design concepts that best fit the ideas that we had. Shown below is the three design concepts that we created based of the ideas that we came up with.

This is our team's second concept. This concept includes a temperature sensor, an LED, a microcontroller, a motor, and a battery. This design will be connected to the user through WiFI and the user would be able to turn on the robot through a mobile device. When the user turns on the robot, the user will be able to turn the top piece to the direction of their choice. The LED will show if the system is on and reading the temperature sensor.

This is our team's first design concept, which is a car-shaped patrol temperature monitoring robot, which has temperature sensors, LEDs, four wheels, motors, and gears. Based on this design, it can be connected to the user with WIFI, so that the user can see the temperature change anywhere. At the same time, we hope that the user can also use the mobile phone to remotely control the direction of the car, (this is also hoped for Use the gear to change the direction or use four motors to control different directions), so that users can remotely monitor where they want to monitor, and can go to any place they want to monitor. At the same time, we also hope that users can set the "alarm" temperature by themselves, so that once the temperature reaches the alarm temperature, the LED will flash to warn the user, and an alarm will also be displayed on the mobile phone.

This is our team’s third design, The Box. Just like the previous designs, this design also consists of a temp sensor, a LED, a motor module, a microcontroller and an LED display. The main goal of this design is to make sure that the device is compatible and easy to carry. In this design you can see two different layers. On the outside, the LED, Temp sensor and the microcontroller is present. On the left side, you can see the LED display that displays the amount of temperature, read by the temp sensor and when we go deep inside, we can notice the motor module and the battery module. The battery module also works as a power bank, the can save up energy when charged to be used later. The battery is charged by the power module which is mentioned as a charging port in the diagram and present at the bottom of the device. In the right view, we can see different types of ports which are used to connect to any device to read the temperature. This design also has the feature of connecting to WIFI and bluetooth when needed.

:star:During the discussion, our team decided that since our idea is focused on reducing temperature, and that our motor should be linked to the temperature sensor. This made us to come to a conclusion of a fan like structure that is portabl. Whlie brainstroming our three designs, we tried to combine them and figured that the one with the highest interaction with temperature is our fan design. Whenever the surrounding temperature is higher than the room temperature, our fan will start to rotate to reduce the temperature. In the current design, the PCB will be inside the body of the fan and the motor will be at the top, connected to the fan propller and further, we also consider adding OLED to display the room temperature.

Selected Design:

## Block Diagram
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Block%20Diagram-314.drawio.png?raw=true)

:star:The team 303 came togeather to discuss about the block diagram and first we determined the functions we need (motor driver, temperature sensor, WIFI module, ICSP), and then we find the pins we need according to the datasheet of the Microcontroller we choose. We splitted the subsystems among ourselfs and found that The subsystems meets all the product requirment. The motor driver meets the SPI and actuator reqiurment and the tempeture sensor meets the I2C requirment. The temperature and the motor subsystems are connnected to the microcontroller. When the temperature sensor reads the temperature, it sends signal to the motor driver which 
then adjusts the speed depending upon it. The motor driver is SPI and connected to external power supply. The temperature sensor is I2C and is connected to a 12V to 3.3V voltage regulator which is also connected to the wall supply. 
:star:We have Microcontroller to control WIFI Module, Temperature Sensor and Motor driver. Then there is ICSP pin interface to program through Cadence.

## Component Selection

<a href="Component Selection.pdf">Complete Component Selection</a>

## Voltage Regulator
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Voltage%20Rgulator.png?raw=true)

This Voltage Regulator has the lowest price and the highest availability. At the same time, it meets the requirements of our project, safe to use, can withstand severe temperature changes, stable 3.3V output and 1A safe current output.As well being surface mount.

## Power Supply
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Power%20Source.png?raw=true)

The team opted to use the AC/DC 12V power supply due to its ease of use and consistent 12V supply. The loss of portability is made up for by the convenience of not needing to replace batteries after repeated usage.

## Temperature Sensor
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Temperature%20Sensor.png?raw=true)

The reason for selecting this Temp. Sensor is that it is easier to use as are using it in class. It is also the cheapest option out of the three options. It also meets the I2C and surface mount requirements. 

## Motor Driver
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Motor%20Driver.png?raw=true)

This Motor driver is the better suite compare to other ones we viewed, due to its efficiency even when the cost is higher than the others. It also meets the SPI and Surface mount requirment.

## Mictocontroller
<a href="microcontroller-selection-table.docx (2).pdf">Complete microcontroller Selection is here</a>

This is the PIC that we choose:

![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/medium-PIC18F27Q10-SOIC-28.png?raw=true)

We compared three PICs, and after comparing the benefits, we finally decided to use this PIC because:

This is very practical, and the price is affordable, and the delivery time is very timely. At the same time, it also meets the needs of all course projects: with i2c communication, with UART, suitable for MPlab IDE, and suitable for MCC Melody. Also the In-System Programming Capability and Type is ICSP which fulfills the project requirement. There is also a complete programming tutorial for the temperature sensor, so our team thought this would be the best choice.



First of all, we have all of our electrical component be surface amount.

![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Power%20budget.png?raw=true)

We found the required voltage and the required power consumption from the data sheets of the respective components, and then subtracted the voltage consumed by these components from our power source to roughly calculate whether our power source can support the voltage of these components consume.

Team 303 together worked on the component selection and came up with the best fit for our subsystems together. We first decided upon who is taking up which subsystem and split your component selection into three different sectors. Every individual in Team 303 worked seperately on their component selection at first and found the top three options based every single details, such as its voltage capacity, price, its power supply etc from the datasheet, compared all the three once again to finalise with one product. Later again when it was doe, we all met once again to discuss on the finalised product. 



## Hardware Proposal
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Team%20Schematic.png?raw=true)

Our Hardware design was split into 3 subsystems for each group member to work on. The subsytems that the members worked on include: Voltage regulater and PIC, Temperture Sensor, and Motor Driver and Motor. The power regulater subsystem The Regulator subsystem has a barrel jack connector input .  The 3A max power draw will never be met or exceeded in normal operating conditions, so a 3A fuse will help protect the circuit in a worst case scenario.  The 12V is stepped down and regulated to 3.3V for the PIC, sensor, motor controller, and motor to be powered by. The PIC is also wired with global tags to each other subsystem. The Temperature Sensor subsystem contains the temperature sensor and conditioning circuit. The Motor Subsystem contains both the motor and its motor controller. The motor is controlled by 4 inputs from the PIC via global tags. The motor and controller are powered off of 3.3V which is enough for the motor to turn at an acceptable speed for our intended use. It also has LEDs and Test point for debugging and a WiFi Module which is esp 32 so the user can connect to our device through Bluetooth and Monitor real-time temperature through mobile phone. We use ICSP pin for programming our pic. 

It satisfies the product requirements by having the tempeture sensor to be I2C and the motor driver to be SPI. It also satisfies it by being able to capture enviromental conditions.

And here is our Bill of Materials:

![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Bill%20of%20Materials.png?raw=true)

We list out all the Materials that we gonna use and also their Vendor link , Datasheet Link, Supplier,Manufacturer,Manufacturer Part and Schematic Reference Designators.

## Software Proposal
![image caption](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303.github.io/blob/main/Software%20Proposal.drawio.png?raw=true)

We initialize the system first, then set up all hardware registers, and establish our communication (i2C for temperature sensor, spi for motor driver). All this is to make our function successful.

Our software is mainly to check whether a dangerous temperature has been set. Once the set temperature is reached, our motor will rotate with the fan blades (thus achieving a cooling effect).
