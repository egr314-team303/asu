## Team Organization
(The Complete Team Organization is here [Appendix A:Team Organization](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/Team%20Charter.pdf?raw=true))

* Charter

**Success Metrics**

1. Products need to convey information to users as accurately as possible
1. The product ideally should have a rechargeable battery with a lifespan of at least one hour.
1. The product needs to be low energy so as to not be a danger to users.
1. The product needs to have a sustainable lifespan.
1. The product needs to be portable

**Shared Goals**

Our team looks to find success within this project by creating a robotic system that can accurately detect and provide to those who are wanting to detect nearby temperature and humidity anywhere. By creating a design that is elegant and works efficiently, we hope to present to our stakeholders a project that we can all be proud of.

* Mission Statement

Our mission is to design and construct a robotic device that can demonstrate the advantages of simplicity, portability and precise detection of temperature and humidity. Our team is committed to developing a product which is safe for stakeholders to interact with a mobile phone connected via WiFi, while also providing a motion capability that can be detected by moving into tight places.

## User Needs,Benchmarking,and Requirements

The complete User Needs is here([Appendix B:complete User Needs](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/User%20Needs%20and%20Benchmarking%20303.pdf?raw=true))

The first thing we did for user needs was that we set up a jam board so that each member of the team could write down the user needs they thought were important.

Then we separate them by different functions, "Tech Constraints", "Function", "Interactivity".

Finally, we ranked them in order of importance.

After that we started Benchmarking and started listening to the voice of our Customer.

Here is a example of our selected product:

Then we researched the source and price of this product and the description of this product. At the same time, we also conducted research on the after-sales evaluation of this product. We extracted the customer needs we need from customer evaluations, and then transformed them into product requirements for our own robot research and development.
