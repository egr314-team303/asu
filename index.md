## Team Organization
(The Complete Team Organization is here [Appendix A:Team Organization](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/Team%20Charter.pdf?raw=true))

* Charter

**Success Metrics**

1. Products need to convey information to users as accurately as possible
1. The product ideally should have a rechargeable battery with a lifespan of at least one hour.
1. The product needs to be low energy so as to not be a danger to users.
1. The product needs to have a sustainable lifespan.
1. The product needs to be portable

**Shared Goals**

Our team looks to find success within this project by creating a robotic system that can accurately detect and provide to those who are wanting to detect nearby temperature and humidity anywhere. By creating a design that is elegant and works efficiently, we hope to present to our stakeholders a project that we can all be proud of.

* Mission Statement

Our mission is to design and construct a robotic device that can demonstrate the advantages of simplicity, portability and precise detection of temperature and humidity. Our team is committed to developing a product which is safe for stakeholders to interact with a mobile phone connected via WiFi, while also providing a motion capability that can be detected by moving into tight places.

## User Needs,Benchmarking,and Requirements

The complete User Needs is here<a href="User Needs and Benchmarking 303.pdf">Complete User Needs and Benchmarking</a>

* The first thing we did for user needs was that we set up a jam board so that each member of the team could write down the user needs they thought were important.

Then we separated them into 3 seperate catergories, "Tech Constraints", "Function", "Interactivity".

Lastly, we ranked them in order of importance. The proccess in which we ranked them was done by taking the user needs that we came up with and comparing them with customer needs from the voice of the customer.

After that we started Benchmarking and started listening to the voice of our Customer. 

Here is a example of our selected product:

:star: From the example of our selected product,We found out that Products have longer lifespan, power efficient and power supplies need to be replaceable are really important.

And here is the user story we collected &#10084:

William is a father with two children. He wants to give his children an intellectual education of engineers at an early stage. He needs a robot that can attract children's attention with interesting performances, and at the same time has monitoring functions (such as temperature, humidity, wind, atmospheric pressure, etc.)

The user story proves that how necessary this product in the society.

* Then we researched the source and price of this product and the description of this product. At the same time, we also conducted research on the after-sales evaluation of this product. We extracted the customer needs we need from customer evaluations, and then transformed them into product requirements for our own robot research and development. (For complete research, please see the complete User Needs above)

* After collecting user requirements, we began to brainstorm and come up with a hundred design ideas based on these user requirements (See Design Ideation below).

## Design Ideation

* The role of each person in the group was to come up with 50 design ideas each that in total came up to 100 ideas that we can potentially use in our design concepts.

* After coming up with the 100 ideas, we then came to together in person to brainstorm and decide which ideas were the best from the 100 ideas. We decided that brainstorming in person was more effective and successful then doing it virtually or seprately because we were able to come up with more ideas and better quality ideas.

* We then took the 100 ideas and came up with three design concepts that best fit the ideas that we had. Shown below is the three design concepts that we created based of the ideas that we came up with.

This is our team's second concept. This concept includes a temperature sensor, an LED, a microcontroller, a motor, and a battery. This design will be connected to the user through WiFI and the user would be able to turn on the robot through a mobile device. When the user turns on the robot, the user will be able to turn the top piece to the direction of their choice. The LED will show if the system is on and reading the temperature sensor.

This is our team's first design concept, which is a car-shaped patrol temperature monitoring robot, which has temperature sensors, LEDs, four wheels, motors, and gears. Based on this design, it can be connected to the user with WIFI, so that the user can see the temperature change anywhere. At the same time, we hope that the user can also use the mobile phone to remotely control the direction of the car, (this is also hoped for Use the gear to change the direction or use four motors to control different directions), so that users can remotely monitor where they want to monitor, and can go to any place they want to monitor. At the same time, we also hope that users can set the "alarm" temperature by themselves, so that once the temperature reaches the alarm temperature, the LED will flash to warn the user, and an alarm will also be displayed on the mobile phone.

This is our teamâ€™s third design, The Box. Just like the previous designs, this design also consists of a temp sensor, a LED, a motor module, a microcontroller and an LED display. The main goal of this design is to make sure that the device is compatible and easy to carry. In this design you can see two different layers. On the outside, the LED, Temp sensor and the microcontroller is present. On the left side, you can see the LED display that displays the amount of temperature, read by the temp sensor and when we go deep inside, we can notice the motor module and the battery module. The battery module also works as a power bank, the can save up energy when charged to be used later. The battery is charged by the power module which is mentioned as a charging port in the diagram and present at the bottom of the device. In the right view, we can see different types of ports which are used to connect to any device to read the temperature. This design also has the feature of connecting to WIFI and bluetooth when needed.

:star:During the discussion, our team decided that since our sensor is a temperature sensor, our motor should be linked to the temperature. Among our three designs, the one with the highest interaction with temperature is our fan design. Whenever the temperature is too high, our fan will start to rotate to reduce the temperature. Further, we will consider adding OLED to display the current temperature.

:star:First we determine the functions we need (motor, temperature sensor, WIFI module, ICSP), and then we find the pins we need according to the datasheet of the Microcontroller we choose.

:star:We have Microcontroller to control WIFI Module, Temperature Sensor and Motor driver. Then there is ICSP pin interface to program through Cadence.
