## Team Organization
(The Complete Team Organization is here [Appendix A:Team Organization](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/Team%20Charter.pdf?raw=true))

* Charter

**Success Metrics**

1. Products need to convey information to users as accurately as possible
1. The product ideally should have a rechargeable battery with a lifespan of at least one hour.
1. The product needs to be low energy so as to not be a danger to users.
1. The product needs to have a sustainable lifespan.
1. The product needs to be portable

**Shared Goals**

Our team looks to find success within this project by creating a robotic system that can accurately detect and provide to those who are wanting to detect nearby temperature and humidity anywhere. By creating a design that is elegant and works efficiently, we hope to present to our stakeholders a project that we can all be proud of.

* Mission Statement

Our mission is to design and construct a robotic device that can demonstrate the advantages of simplicity, portability and precise detection of temperature and humidity. Our team is committed to developing a product which is safe for stakeholders to interact with a mobile phone connected via WiFi, while also providing a motion capability that can be detected by moving into tight places.

## User Needs,Benchmarking,and Requirements

The complete User Needs is here([Appendix B:complete User Needs](https://github.com/egr314-team303/egr314-team303-asu.github.io/blob/main/User%20Needs%20and%20Benchmarking%20303.pdf?raw=true))

* The first thing we did for user needs was that we set up a jam board so that each member of the team could write down the user needs they thought were important.

Then we separated them into 3 seperate functions, "Tech Constraints", "Function", "Interactivity".

Finally, we ranked them in order of importance.

After that we started Benchmarking and started listening to the voice of our Customer.

Here is a example of our selected product:

* Then we researched the source and price of this product and the description of this product. At the same time, we also conducted research on the after-sales evaluation of this product. We extracted the customer needs we need from customer evaluations, and then transformed them into product requirements for our own robot research and development. (For complete research, please see the complete User Needs above)

* After collecting user requirements, we began to brainstorm and come up with a hundred design ideas based on these user requirements (See Design Ideation below).

## Design Ideation

* The role of each person in the group was to come up with 50 design ideas each that in total came up to 100 ideas that we can potentially use in our design concepts.

* After coming up with the 100 ideas, we then came to together in person to brainstorm and decide which ideas were the best from the 100 ideas. We decided that brainstorming in person was more effective and successful then doing it virtually or seprately because we were able to come up with more ideas and better quality ideas.

* We then took the 100 ideas and came up with three design concepts that best fit the ideas that we had. Shown below is the three design concepts that we created based of the ideas that we came up with.
