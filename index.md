* Charter

**Success Metrics**

1. Products need to convey information to users as accurately as possible
1. The product ideally should have a rechargeable battery with a lifespan of at least one hour.
1. The product needs to be low energy so as to not be a danger to users.
1. The product needs to have a sustainable lifespan.
1. The product needs to be portable

**Shared Goals**

Our team looks to find success within this project by creating a robotic system that can accurately detect and provide to those who are wanting to detect nearby temperature and humidity anywhere. By creating a design that is elegant and works efficiently, we hope to present to our stakeholders a project that we can all be proud of.

* Mission Statement
Our mission is to design and construct a robotic device that can demonstrate the advantages of simplicity, portability and precise detection of temperature and humidity. Our team is committed to developing a product which is safe for stakeholders to interact with a mobile phone connected via WiFi, while also providing a motion capability that can be detected by moving into tight places.
