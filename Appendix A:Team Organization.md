Success Metrics

Products need to convey information to users as accurately as possible
The product ideally should have a rechargeable battery with a lifespan of at least one hour.
The product needs to be low energy so as to not be a danger to users.
The product needs to have a sustainable lifespan.
The product needs to be portable

	Shared Goals
The product should be something that each team member can proudly present to an employer as a showcase of our skills as fledgling engineers.
The product should function consistently and effectively, not requiring constant tweaking to operate correctly.
The design should have a focus on modular components for future adaptability and to encourage creativity from users.
Design and fabrication of the product should improve our team’s understanding of embedded systems design and comfort with translating project ideas into working, real-world projects.
The product should improve our understanding of how the shape of physical components and properties of materials influence movement.
The product should simply and effectively communicate a technological concept to the relevant stakeholders.
Consolidated Charter
“Our team looks to find success within this project by creating a robotic system that can accurately detect and provide to those who are wanting to detect nearby temperature and humidity anywhere. By creating a design that is elegant and works efficiently, we hope to present to our stakeholders a project that we can all be proud of."

	Mission Statement

Our mission is to design and construct a robotic device that can demonstrate the advantages of simplicity, portability and precise detection of temperature and humidity. Our team is committed to developing a product which is safe for stakeholders to interact with a mobile phone connected via WiFi, while also providing a motion capability that can be detected by moving into tight places.

Communication Procedure

Our team decided to communicate with group text and discord. Our means of sharing documents amongst each other is through the use of a shared google drive. Responses should not take more than 2 days for coordinating assignments or meetings.

Meeting Schedule	


Meeting Coordination


1. 	Our team will hold meetings on Monday and Wednesdays at 6pm to complete any            physical building or 
project design, and hold online meetings on Fridays or Saturdays to plan for future project goals.

	Monday & Wednesday: 6PM - 7PM
	Friday: 12PM - 2PM

2. 	Whenever there is a meeting we will remind each other in the discord or face to face

3. 	When it is necessary or more convenient,  we will cooperate at a time when everyone is 
available in discord

4.	Face-to-face meetings is our team’s preferred method of project planning and 
coordination.



	Team Coordination

1. The team as a collective will ensure communication channels are used often as a means to coordinate that assignments are completed and submitted on time. Team members are expected to review the agreed upon communication channels daily, at a minimum, to ensure no lapse in communication. Zhengbin will be the team’s primary means of submitting assignments, with Abdulrizak as a backup if required.

2. The team is committed to lending a helping hand to each other when a member is facing difficulties with assigned materials or tasks. If the team is unable to help a member despite their efforts, the struggling team member is responsible for attending office hours in order to seek better understanding of the material or task in question. If even office hours are unable to alleviate the issue, that team member will be shuffled to a different task on the project more suited to their abilities.


3. Every assignment will be an open document on a shared drive for the team to have access to at any time. Once the team receives feedback from a submitted assignment, that feedback will be submitted onto the drive as well as shared through the discord to ensure each team member has an opportunity to address key issues. Feedback which is relevant to an individual will be communicated to that individual by the team as a whole, and it is that individual's responsibility to address that feedback within the design.
